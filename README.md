# odin-recipes
The purpose of this project is to test how much I've learned from the past
several lessons. The skills I'll be demonstrating include: 
    - Creating a website using html
    - Creating boilerplate from memory
    - Making atomic commits
    - Making strong, concise commit messages
    - Using the command line to commit
    - Using tags to create lists, headers, italics, bold, etc.
    - Adding images to the site
    - Adding links for navigation between multiple pages
    - Following rules of proper commit messages
