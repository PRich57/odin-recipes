                <li>Fettuccine - uncooked</li>
                <li>Chicken - boneless skinless</li>
                <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
                <li>Paprika</li>
                <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
                <li>Olive Oil</li>
                <li>Cream Cheese</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Heavy Cream</li>
                <li>Parmesan Cheese - shredded</li>
                <li>Parsley - fresh</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the pasta by cooking in a large pot of salted water according to package instructions. Once the pasta is tender, reserve one cup of the pasta water, then drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the chicken by pounding the chicken breasts to an even thickness using a rolling pin or a heavy pot. Season both sides with salt, pepper, paprika, and Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li>PRO TIP: pounding your chicken may seem like an unnecessary step, but rest assured, it’ll help create the juiciest chicken after it’s been cooked. Do not skip it!</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add in the olive oil. Cook the chicken on both sides for three to five minutes, until the chicken is browned and cooked through to 165 degrees F. Removed chicken from the pan and place it on a plate, lightly covering it with tin foil for five minutes to rest. </li>
                <li>In the same skillet used for the chicken, reduce the heat to add in the butter. Once melted, add in the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add in the cream cheese and whisk gently until the cream cheese is mostly melted into the butter.<br> The mixture will look a little clumpy, like cottage cheese. This is normal!</li>
                <li>Gradually pour in the heavy cream while whisking until the mixture becomes smooth. Add in the parmesan cheese and stir until melted through.</li>
                <li>To the sauce, add in the cooked fettuccine noodles and toss to coat. If needed, use the reserved pasta sauce to add more moisture to the sauce and pasta. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Slice the chicken breast into strips and serve over the noodles. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and more freshly cracked pepper. Enjoy hot!</li>
