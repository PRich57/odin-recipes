            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>What can I say? I'm a guy who has an insatiable sweet tooth! This pumpkin pie recipe just might be my all time favorite food.</p>
            <p>Maybe it's nostalgia and it brings back memories of the leaves changing colors and the summer heat fading away, but no matter the reasons, this recipe has my stamp of approval.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            
            <h3>For the Graham Cracker Crust</h3>
            <ul>
               <li><b>1 &frac34; cups</b> ground graham crackers</li>
               <li><b>2 tablespoons</b> brown sugar</li>
               <li><b>8 tablespoons</b> unsalted butter, melted</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For the Filling</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1 pound</b> pumpkin puree, at room temperature</li>
                <li><b>&frac12; cup</b> brown sugar</li>
                <li><b>3</b> eggs, at room temperature</li>
                <li><b>&frac12; cup</b> heavy cream, at room temperature</li>

                <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> ground cinnamon</li>
                <li><b>&frac12; teaspoon</b> ground ginger</li>
                <li><b>Pinch</b> of grated nutmeg</li>
                <li><b>Pinch</b> of cloves and/or allspice</li>
                <li><b><em>OR</em>use 1 &frac12; teaspoons</b> pumpkin spice mix <em>(instead of the cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves or allspice)</em></li>
                <li><b>&frac14; teaspoon</b> of salt</li>
                <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> vanilla extract or paste</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>For the Whipped Cream</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>1 cup</b> double, heavy, or whipping cream</li>
                <li><b>1 &frac12; tablespoons</b> sour cream or cream cheese</li>
                <li><b>3 tablespoons</b> powdered sugar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Turn on the oven at 350&deg;F/180&deg;C</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For the Crust:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine ground graham crackers with sugar in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the melter butter and stir until it looks like wet sand.</li>
                <li>Pat on a 9-inch pie plate (24cm) covering bottom and sides. Begin pressing at the angle where the bottom meets the side, press up the sides, and finally cover the bottom.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate while making the filling.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For the Pumpkin Filling:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the pumpkin puree with sugar in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Add eggs one by one, mixing well each time. I use a whisk. If you want to use an electric mixer, do so at the lowest speed.</li>
                <li>Add sour cream and cream (liquid, straight from the container) and mix well. Do not beat the mixture but integrate it well.</li>
                <li>Add spices, vanilla, and salt, and mix until smooth and creamy.</li>
                <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 40 minutes or until it's *almost* firm in the center. It should still jiggle a little.</li>
                <li>Let cool completely on a wire rack, cover it with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for several hours (or up to 2 days) before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve with a dollop of whipped cream dusted with cinnamon.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>For the Whipping Cream:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat cold cream with sour cream/cream cheese and powdered sugar in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Consistency of the cream: I like it to be thick but soft, so I whip it to medium peaks. But you can go all the way and beat it to firm peaks, similar to chantilly cream.</li>
                <li><b><u>Be carful it doesn't curdle</u>.</b> It's what happens if it's overbeaten. You might want to beat with and electric mixer until you're <em>almost there</em> and then end it by hand with a whisk. It's hard to overbeat a preparation with a manual whisk.</li>
            </ol>
